    "## Exploration mechanism and the learning mechanism of Constant-alpha Monte Carlo\n",
    "\n",
    "The exploration mechanism is dependent on the $0 < \\epsilon \\leq 1$ value, which is an exploration rate and the greedy policy $\\pi$, which takes the $\\underset{a}{\\max} q(s, a)$. $\\epsilon$ is determining the probability of making random action that is used to enhance policy. After each episode the $q(s,a)$ is updated by the formula $q(s_{t}^{m},a_{t}^{m}) \\gets q(s_{t}^{m},a_{t}^{m})+\\alpha(G_{t}^{m}-q(s_{t}^{m},a_{t}^{m}))$, $m$ is a sample number, $t$ is the step in the sample, which is basically $q(s_{t}^{m},a_{t}^{m})$ with added difference of the discounted return $G_{t}^{m}$ for the $s_{t}^{m}$ and $a_{t}^{m}$ with itself multiplied by constant $\\alpha$. This serves as learning mechanism as it allows to estimate true value of the $q(s, a)$."
